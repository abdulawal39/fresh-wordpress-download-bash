# fresh-wordpress-download-bash
This repo includes a bash script that will just download the latest version of wordpress, extract that to the current folder and then move the files over from wordpress subdirectory to current directory which makes it ready for you to just go ahead and create mysql database and setup remaining installation from browser.
